Every Horrocube have a distinct policy id, this is because Horrocubes NFTs leverage the power of Plutus minting policy scripts to create true NFTs; once these NFTs are minted, it is impossible to create a duplicate. The minting policy of this type of NFT takes and validates as a parameter a specific UXTO and makes sure the UTXO is spent during the minting transaction.

You can learn more about it in the following lecture that Lars Br√ºnjes made for the Plutus Pioneer Program:
